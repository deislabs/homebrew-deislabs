# Homebrew Tap for Porter

For users on MacOS, the Porter project maintains a <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> tap to install and keep Porter up-to-date. 

<p align="center">Learn all about Porter at <a href="https://porter.sh">porter.sh</a></p>

ðŸš¨ This isn't ready to use yet. We will update this page with the proper commands to run once our tap is complete!
